# Project State

> **Single source of truth for "where are we right now."** Updated at the end of every sprint warm-down.

---

## Active sprint

**Sprint number:** `4`
**Sprint name:** Polish + 1.0
**Status:** `not-started`
**Goal:** The bridge generalization is released: a latency report across both backends within budget, docs current, every RFC risk resolved or backlogged, and a final live demo through AI SDK + Mastra plus suspend/resume.
**WBS section:** [`sprints/WBS.md` § Sprint 4](./WBS.md)

## Build branch

**Active build branch:** `v2`

Every sprint session — manager and IC — works **on this branch only**. Before Step 1 of the kickoff, confirm `git branch --show-current` matches. All story commits (`[S{N}-{nn}]`), fix-pass (`[S{N}-fix]`), and closeout (`[S{N}-close]`) land here. Do **not** commit to `main` mid-sprint.

At session start: `git checkout v2` (or `git fetch && git checkout v2` if missing locally).

## Load-bearing reading for sprint 4

The session running sprint 4 must read these in this order before any story:

1. `sprints/sprint-3/HANDOFF.md` — read-me-first: state of the world (all 3 backends working/deployed) + traps.
2. `sprints/WBS.md` § Sprint 4 — stories S4-01 … S4-03.
3. `docs/latency-budget.md` — the S1-00 baseline/band (the denominator) + where the cross-backend report (S4-01) appends.
4. `docs/rfc-reasoner-bridge.md` §7 (validation) + §9 (risk closeout, S4-03).
5. The shipped APIs to document (S4-02): `packages/voice/src/reasoner.ts`, `voice-bridge-aisdk` (`ReasoningBridge`/`from-ai-sdk`/`RunStore`), `voice-bridge-mastra` (`from-mastra`), `voice-server-workers-mastra`.

**Carry-forward traps (from Sprint 3):** **KI-3-01** — `pnpm -r test` flakes under concurrency (`voice-server-websocket`, `voice-stt-google` 5 s-timeout tests, pass in isolation, NOT Reasoner-bridge regressions) — judge green per-package. Latency report uses the **short fixture** (`SYRINX_WS_MAX_TURNS=1`) vs the S1-00 band. Mastra-edge worker is **Paid tier** (8 MB); bundle diet is backlog (KI-3-02). **No new deps** in Sprint 4 — it's report + docs + risk closeout + the trunk PR. **Capstone = `v2`→trunk PR — confirm with the user before opening/merging.** All three demos already proven: AI-SDK deployed (`cc9236aa`), Mastra Node (S2) + edge deployed (`40a15353`), suspend/resume deployed.

## Backlog deltas this project life

`(none — see WBS §4 for the seeded backlog: B-01 Realtime, B-02 multi-agent, B-03 @mastra/ai-sdk path, B-04 alias removal)`

## Open RFC amendments

`(none)`

## How to use this file

- A new session reads this file **first** to know which sprint is active and which sections of which docs are load-bearing right now.
- The session running a sprint **does not edit this file mid-sprint**. Updates land at warm-down.
- At warm-down, the session updates: active sprint pointer, **build branch** (only if it changed), load-bearing reading for the next sprint, last-completed fields, sprint history table, backlog deltas, and any open RFC amendments.
